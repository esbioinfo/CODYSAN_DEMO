					Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is a heterogeneous group of inherited hematological disorders. 
					Patients have chronic anemia of variable degree due to poor development of red blood cells (inefficient erythropoiesis),
					and morphological defects of erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow. Other frequent clinical manifestations are jaundice,
					enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and / or liver (hepatomegaly). The first symptoms usually appear during childhood 
					or neonatal period. Patients require repeated blood transfusions in order to stabilize the anemia. Currently there are 5 
					subtypes of CDA described that are caused by mutations in different genes. In the laboratory of Dr. Mayka Sanchez a panel of genes 
					related to iron metabolism has been developed, including genes described in the different subtypes of CDA, to improve molecular 
					diagnosis in these patients. In addition, the identification of the mutated gene allows a more adequate treatment to be applied 
					in affected individuals.

					Now, thanks to the support of the Association of relatives and patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (ADISCON) 
					and the Pablo Ugarte Association (APU), the group of Dr. Mayka Sanchez has been able to hire two young researchers to 
					carry out the project. "Towards an improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type 2". 
					The collaboration of groups of patients and society is essential to continue research into rare diseases, as is the case of CDA, 
					since public funds have been reduced in recent years.

					<h2>Laura Zalba, Researcher in the CoDysAn project</h2>

					<i>I decided to study the degree of Genetics because it was one of the subjects that attracted me the
					most about biology during high school. In addition, my professor emphasized the importance that this 
					field would have in the study of human diseases. What I did not imagine is that something that started 
					as "well, let's see how it goes", was going to fascinate me so much. I have a great interest in the study
					of human genetics and I am happy knowing that the work I do in research can help to understand a little 
					better the molecular mechanisms of many human diseases, being able to fine-tune in their genetic diagnosis 
					and get to improve the quality of life of patients. I firmly know that my future lies in research; to continue 
					feeding my curiosity, to understand a little better where we come from, why we are what we are or what makes us 
					equal but at the same time different. So, I thank the APU Foundation and ADISCON to make my dream possible and 
					be able to be remunerated through their donations.</i>
